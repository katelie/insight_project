drinking buttermilk culturally insensitive diss food i’m terribly sorry way came could came entire post absurdity found something off-putting love hence buttermilk final recipe next time would strain strawberry mixture seeds settle bottom make drink gritty question food attitude sensitivities agree it’s rude childish “ew ” reaction culturally iconic food way badly expressed sometimes generally think food personal lot people especially ones read websites like often completely illogically feel disappointed someone like “ew ” reaction one favourite foods like discovering boyfriend/girlfriend hates favourite book film jenny thanks makes sense seeds i’m usually insane grit bothering always sieve especially blackberries raspberries didn’t didn’t bother although market berries might tinier

food justify rudeness sadly sometimes appear comments rather read angry comments sometimes think author disappointed food blogger admire doesn’t share opinion important food life expresses disappointment badly liking certain foods/cultural insensitivity think poster might valid point particular food unique certain culture since buttermilk it’s many similar variants consumed peoples world don’t think claimed bashing particular group people’s beloved food see comments many people including many americans born love i’m west coast born bred particularly specific ethnic ties … eastern european russian southern south asian roots love case don’t think poster claim ownership food identified specific culture would like saying “i’m sure i’ve always thoroughly grossed-out honey” someone becoming upset culture put honey everything standard sweetener therefore must subtly casting aspersions claiming superiority food choices problem everyone everywhere uses honey different degrees claim made it’s way culturally directed furthermore thought said hated buttermilk “wow usually mirror tastes perfectly obtusely wrong get lady … it’s delicious ” i.e allowing feel put rather

post titles aren’t shouting can’t zoom husband’s reaction opening computer “it tablet friendly it’s right middle makes look kind stupid computer mean it’s ok guess .” i’ve reader years honestly don’t love looking new big clunky format maybe i’ll stop reading tablet read computer work design read lot cooking blogs i’ve got say time ever you’ve done something really seems “off” maybe something focused visual detail scale living makes hyper- aware hey long-time reader though rarely post comments perhaps never can’t recall know you’re probably getting inundated opinions & feedback new site & it’s awesome you’re listening closely followers wanted throw two cents congrats new site haven’t spent lot time exploring yet one thing that’s hard notice banner ad top previously new layout pretty big banner advertising raid kills roaches it’s nearly pretty wish advertising could less glaring wasn’t we’re trying different spots see works we’re looking alternatives sorry gross ad haven’t seen quite often relate previous searches centrally issued example always get madewell jcrew ads currently kid duvet covers diapers perhaps predictably new site pretty miss navigation left must admit nice i’m sorry ads new recipe index great love able switch list photos one never enough pictures chocolate stuff know new design exciting issues site looks laptop macbook phone experience definitely much improved new version hope developers address issues laptop/desktop layout please take comments grain salt haven’t much caffeine today hate change oh i’m coming back report changed mind recipe index much better liked able read click scroll also don’t get way works looks pretty though really don’t like text starting left side thing mentioned open page there’s huge ad top sk logo sad last least font feels too… tacky hope helps yeah give us serifs back sheesh old font also sans-serif general sans-serif reads better web serif reads better print say typography experts outsource decisions larger vastly readable people know it’s big change everyone regardless top ad don’t love either looking alternatives patient i’m one-person “team” running site addressing concerns quickly couple things new site super big fan looooongtime reader i’m true “consumer” site give credit teaching cook bake ps addition logging make comment don’t like default wordpress name “tracimsmith” listed instead name entered form i’m seeing others meant comments actually could cause folks embarrassment don’t know it’s going happen example wordpress name something like hottiehotterson44 don’t really want listed baking site… sure i’m making sense going get fixed asap i’m sorry trouble appreciate feedback agree least 99 % looking ad spaces/options hadn’t realized banner would dominating thought we’d try 90 % websites one also cluttered designs they’re barely noticed b outside reading area mind outside reading area better inside reading area regardless don’t love we’ll get right soon wordpress logging shouldn’t happening we’re going get fixed comment sorting needs finetuning always love reading “blather”…honestly i’ve said coming someone phd english loves cook—your blog whole package well-written sharp prose amazing food also i’m excited new delineations comments section genius great seeing ad first thing annoying don’t even see picture recipe till one click bad user experience terrible advise website beautiful love season section feels enough like “old” smitten kitchen shocking time fresh modern would totally done let look options absolutely wonderful new site must huge effort make happy excited read baby food section find whoops use link i’ll get back index soon could filed things designers assigned thus bad looks absolutely fabulous iphone – wonderful even love mac first thing see big advertisement also righthand side page almost advertisement site content anyway make ads smaller desktop version really off-putting disappointing usually read site mac small consideration… ps – bunny cake cuteness ps – read comments others – perhaps mac ads enormous really take away whole site… little 11-inch macbook air top ad 1 third page one right hand side equally annoying… took screenshot – figure send doesn’t sound right ad banner “sticky” one sidebar stays scroll shouldn’t take areas it’s bottom sidebar there’s nothing still issue great changes going magazine format thanks letting know filed ticket hi i’m long time reader blog moved first apartment eight years ago realized idea cook anything besides pasta jarred tomato sauce didn’t even internet apartment found blog work computer printed recipes took back home attempt make dinner like grown love meticulously research test every recipe use non-fussy ingredients give straightforward instructors basically taught cook site still go-to looking recipes even years know looking things i’m sure within week two we’ll 85 % kinks worked thanks patience meantime read site computer phone new design hard read–pale gray letters white backdrop thanks feedback going take closer look font color another question alphabetizing lists recipes one clicks “recipes” “cookies” populates long seemingly unorganized list reader must scroll z speak personal experience can’t find easily i’ll go would mean complaints others ads use adblocker hope won’t become one sites requires users turn adblockers access content don’t go sites require that… anne thanks look also looking alternative ad placements i’m crazy banner either hello glad new responsive site tell many times used phone kitchen sorta tricky view emily 1. realize redesigning site says otherwise time refresh knew time deal fact vast majority people hard read justified text gets “river-y” fonts get regular size plus issues 2. seeing option take cookies appears select cookies recipe index click little square/window icon right next “cookie” takes 2 wow totally missed glad pointed yesterday posted newsletter email ads links today newsletter intact fyi great glad fixed feedback consideration – keep typing search keywords “email address” box newsletter signup mistake think accessible input box/field searching newsletter signup search one newsletter signup box one higher use sure plays mobile platforms think would rather user-unfriendly mobile user also click magnifying glass icon search input field pops we’re going look really miss able go back forward recipes chronological order like paging book chronological also sorted season trying hard adjust mean previous next recipe yes still two places top photo it’s always easy see white arrows built pointing left previous right next it’s last recipe use navigate right comment section there’s another place arrow love new site it’s clean easy read still smitten-y great job definitely going look thanks suggestion second makes much easier browse recipes alphabetical order especially noted another commentator don’t remember exact name recipe vague recollection called i’m glad back site looks great worried maybe shutting need smitten kitchen won’t get rid easily love job previous site perfect forget old… honey love site gone dignified modern professional concise cookbook-like look mom blog giant font match severely disappointed designers feedback printing – loved way recipes old site printed centered page smaller print etc however tried printing relatively short recipe took 2 pages unnecessarily huge font squished left half page love little white space note writing margins seemed excessive sure others issue something consideration also liked old recipes nice ingredients instructions page aren’t constantly flipping pages you’re trying cook light gray/white background easier read enormous billboard-size monitor work smaller monitor use home office probably end user issue overall site design issue speaking difficult read opinion cartoonish curly all-caps font used “like subscribe more” jars eye doesn’t match sleekness overall site design difficult read think genius design aspects included excluded example subscription popup loathed popups past-and they’re much better made comment section-there recipes i’m eager make want read real humans’ experiences you’re superwoman know love website old new disappointed longer option downloading recipes kindle please tell temporary glitch tell certainly never set anything end enable thus haven’t removed feature
