882,i need to make these immediately!
886,cocoa is just easier.
894,is this a particular reason to use wood and not metal or plastic?
898,jacob picture — i forgot!
899,i added something that will more than make up for it.
903,i did use an 8″ square.
923,"i like boxed brownies, too, except for the ones that call for oil instead of butter (which, oddly, are the most available around here)."
926,i never use one.
942,"i have everything at home, so i think i’ll make them."
944,these are similar to the king arthur flour fudgy brownie recipe which also suggests that using cocoa is better than chocolate b/c of the butter fat/sugar reasons.
945,i am totally a convert and  thumb my nose at using any recipe that does involve melting chocolate.
946,"but i’m not totally brownie snobby – even though the recipe is so simple, sometimes i just use box mix and toss in a bunch of extras to make it a little more special."
958,"the missionaries used it because it called for cocoa, which was readily available, rather than baking chocolate which wasn’t."
964,cocoa?
966,these look wonderful and i’m going to make them the next time i need a fix.
984,"some metal can react with acids in a recipe (and cocoa does contain a fair amount of acid), but its unlikely that you’re using an aluminum spoon or whisk."
985,"in other words, there’s no reason to use a wooden spoon specifically here."
1007,"julia, i was taught by my home economics teacher to use a wooden spoon since a metal one would break all the bubbles that you’d been working in."
1035,is using hershey’s cocoa powder kitchen blasphemy?
1037,"deb, can i ask if you used natural or dutch for these?"
1038,and what dp cocoa brand you use or prefer?
1039,i have a stash of valhrona that i save for special treats (it’s black gold) – but use droste and hershey’s special dark as well.
1044,i use a pernigotti (sp) cocoa that i get at williams sonoma.
1052,cocoa powder — using hershey’s is not blasphemy.
1054,i use droste when i need a dutch-process cocoa.
1063,"i don’t want to admit what i made instead with the ingrediants on hand to get a chocolate fix, but this would have been perfect… oh well, there will always be another occasion to suddenly need chocolate in my tummy."
1067,"i usually use the brownie recipe from fry’s cocoa, though i only cook them for 10 minutes and then leave in the oven until cool."
1077,"and i do like the fact that i can use cocoa powder, because who knows when a craving will hit and i don’t always have chocolate on hand."
1078,"btw, i just discovered a video on america’s test kitchen/cooks illustrated that updates the recipe for german chocolate cake using a combo of cocoa powder & bittersweet chocolate instead of the germans chocolate."
1081,"if you use part dark brown sugar and part white sugar, it ups the rich, chewy factor."
1082,i also add semisweet chocolate chips to mine.
1088,i’ll definitely try these with “regular” cocoa powder next time i get around to buying some!
1093,"i am new to us baking, and i find the use of cups very frustrating (and frankly rather amateurish) – especially when dealing with things like cocoa or whole wheat flour!"
1100,i’ve made these brownies a couple of times and really enjoy them (including using hershey’s and droste cocoa powder).
1120,"the mixing method for this recipe is similar to the hershey’s deep dish brownie recipe, which is the method i use."
1121,"i’ve changed the amounts of some ingredients in it to wring more chocolate flavorfrom it, but retain the shiny top (which is the only thing i admire from a boxed brownie’s outcome)  i think blooming the cocoa in the warm butter it what pumps the chocolate flavor up."
1122,"i’m more of a cake-y brownie person (i like a bit of a crumb to baked goods) so i up the cocoa and the flour just a bit, just to keep it from being too muddy or fudgy in texture."
1123,i use the droste cocoa and save the valrhona for other goodies.
1127,"these sound heavenly, and i’ve got some good cocoa to use in them."
1132,i have actually been using a nearly identical recipe for years – it’s on the back of my saco cocoa container!
1136,when i was little my mom made brownies all the time and always used droste cocoa.
1151,"i’ve used cocoa+butter before, but never for brownies."
1157,i was fortunate to have just enough flour to make these today.
1193,an easier alternative (for people who hate double boiling as much as i do); i usually just add melted butter into the bowl with the sugar & cocoa (as opposed to the double boiler method) and it works perfectly!
1202,do you just use a pyrex bowl over a pot of simmering water?
1203,are you supposed to use a non-pyrex kind of glass?
1212,"have been making it (via epicurious) for years, and as you mention, i completely skip the bain-marie in favor of throwing the cocoa, sugar, and butter in the microwave for a minute."
1214,"i have used high and low end cocoa, and it is a perfect brownie, either way."
1224,"i found it took me almost 35 min to get them set, instead of the 20-25min."
1230,i use your classic brownie formula (adapted from cooks illustrated) all the time and swear by it.
1241,"they turned out delicious and fudgy, even though a) i made them before you had posted the pan size, and i don’t have an 8×8 anyway, so they’re a bit thin, and b) i used store-brand cocoa."
1260,but i do have cocoa!!
1286,"my blondies recipe melts the butter and brown sugar together and after 10 minutes, you mix in eggs, vanilla, and flour (pecans are optional)  it produces a bar that gives me a wonderful hit of sweet pecan pie memories."
1300,what about deleting the salt and adding sea salt to the top?
1335,"i used hershey’s cocoa, and they came out fine."
1336,"i’d use a microwave instead of a double boiler next time to melt the butter, to save time."
1338,i always use dark cocoa because it amps up the chocolate flavor even more and i am a fan of excess.
1342,i have been searching forever for an awesome brownie recipe that is fudgy and uses only cocoa powder.
1373,can’t wait to make those brownies!
1385,"i used hershey’s special dark cocoa, and i’d really recommend it."
1390,i replaced half the sugar with some cinnamon sugar i had left over from snicker doodle rolling and they turned out fabulously.
1417,i know it’s not as good as your cocoa but can i hershey’s cocoa powder instead?
1418,"try sprinkling your nuts over the top of the brownie batter instead of mixing them in–not only decorative but tasty, as the nuts toast a bit, and are crisper."
1426,"i used to be a boxed brownie girl, but i haven’t made them since i discovered this recipe."
1432,i would recommend to using a good dark chocolate cocoa.
1475,"in the end, we had to use spoons to scoop it off the baking pan."
1476,think next time should increase the baking time or put in the fridge b4 cutting…
1482,i love using cocoa powder in baking.
1486,"i am gluten free and use coconut flour, so they come out more cakey, but the extreme chocolate factor is still there."
1489,i want to keep tested recipes for both kinds.. sometimes offering cocoa recipes instead is a nice way to variate.
1490,do you or have you ever used silicone products when baking?
1499,did you know that the trick to cutting brownies at any temperature without shredding them is to use a plastic knife?
1504,"essentially, i just opted to use 1/2 butter & 1/2 coconut oil; then in my classic style i usually substitute ww pastry flour, if reasonable."
1506,"as with many cocoa/chocolate recipes, i like to add just a touch of espresso powder."
1512,"made these last night (the beauty of using cocoa powder which everyone has around, eh?)."
1524,i used my as-seen-on-tv “perfect brownie pan” and these actually came out better than anything i had made in it to date.
1531,the secret: i use very strong coffee in place of the water that is called for; or a little expresso powder.
1537,"powdered cocoa rocks, i love a good recipe that uses it so that you can make it to your own level of desired sweetness."
1548,i used hershey’s cocoa powder instead and they taste great.
1550,like kelly (#183) i use green & black’s cocoa.
1562,i have been using alice’s cocoa powder brownie recipe for years.
1581,making these now!
1600,"lots of experts agree the higher acid content of natural cocoa sets eggs sooner in batters (which may help account for the extra cooking times noted in comments when dutched cocoa was used); but otherwise the experts seem to be all over the lot on which is better, and when."
1624,used up the last of my valrhona on these today.
1625,"used the microwave method for combining the cocoa, butter and sugar."
1629,i just substituted gf flour and they came out like perfection!
1636,"oh well, next time i’ll be baking him the one in the box, i’m sure he’ll be a happy camper!"
1637,"i made these with half the cocoa, because when i was in the middle of making them and measured my cocoa i only had 40 grams."
1644,"i have a brownie recipe from maida heatter, i think, which uses only cocoa and it’s fantastic!"
1651,the brownies are so chocolaty and rich despite using just cocoa.
1656,i did make them a bit healthier by cutting the butter in half and replacing the other half with five tablespoons of vanilla yogurt.
1660,"i would think those tests turned out that way because there are times when natural cocoa is best, with its more aggressive flavor."
1662,i went all out and used the scharfenberger cocoa powder.
1667,i used to worry about the whole cast iron pan issue-seemed unsanitary just to wipe it out.
1674,"i personally really dislike the metallic taste of dutch-processed cocoa (v. included…) natural cocoa actually tastes of chocolate, not of cocoa!"
1687,looks like a much better use of the ingredients!
1689,"there are so many comments i couldn’t get through them all…sorry if i’m repeating this…but thank you for listing amounts in grams, i’m in london and have gone out and bought cups but the grams measurement makes the shopping part easier!"
1703,"thank you for always giving us a glimpse of jacob: we are getting to watch him grow up, and change, and hair-adjust."
1707,"and technically, the originally recipe called for unsweetened chocolate squares, but we always used cocoa as a substitute."
1719,did you chill first and use a plastic knife?
1728,"i made these yesterday and it was the perfect end to the weekend…and i used some “throw-away” coco powder that i had to buy, in a pinch, while out of town."
1729,i was just about to toss it…thinking…”why would i ever use this?!
1731,i have a recipe that i found on allrecipes.com and it’s for vegan brownies.
1733,it makes great brownies whether i use dutch-processed cocoa or just natural unsweetened.
1739,re your cutting brownies dilemma – use a plastic knife.
1748,i swaped butter out for oil and that was a huge mistake.
1753,"i used hershey’s special dark, b/c it’s what i had, and i actually really enjoy that cocoa."
1755,"also, i only had one egg on hand, so i substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the other egg."
1757,"i think next time i’ll do the same thing, even if to just lower the fat content since it didn’t alter the taste or texture."
1760,"don’t know if anyone will see this way down here, but fwiw, i waited as you suggested until the brownies were completely cool and used a (very sharp) pizza wheel to cut them which worked beautifully."
1764,i will absolutely try that next time.
1773,"i used dutch-processed cocoa powder (i live in the netherlands, it would be sacrilegious not to) and the chocolate flavor is unbelievable."
1777,"next time i’ll put the pan in the fridge like you suggested, see if it makes any difference and use a sharper knife!"
1784,time.
1800,"i do wish that i used a bit of a smaller panthough, as i thought the brownies came out a bit on the thin side (i used a 9″ square pan)."
1802,i cut down on the sugar and baking time a little bit.
1804,"i have always been really skeptical about using cocoa, but you’ve converted me into a true believer!"
1854,"i made them again the next night, with a half tbsp of ground coffee."
1867,"it’s about double the quantities, though: 1 cup melted butter, 1 cup cocoa, 2 cups sugar, 4 eggs, 1 1/3 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1½ teaspoon vanilla, and ½ teaspoon salt."
1874,"they created a drink with it, but first they used it as currency (like money)."
1884,and i forgot the walnuts!
1887,"and for other readers, i used scharffen berger and they were great/rich, but other chocolate would be ok too i think."
1895,"we do, however, have cocoa!"
1896,"i will make these tonight and use it to smooth away the hot day of dust, culture clash, and political intrigue."
1899,and a shout out to other celiacs who read this blog: you can easily swap the all purpose flour in this recipe for an equal amount of an all purpose gluten free blend (i used gluten free pantry).
1900,"they were awesome, and gluten free."
1917,"hi deb, made these last night, they came out just like your picture (only i had to make them in a 9″ round pan as i don’t have an 8″sq one) – i added a dash of kalhua and as my 1/2 cup of flour came out as 88g, i used 76g of flour, and did a mix of brown and white sugar."
1943,i ran out of ‘good’ cocoa and used the backup hershey’s in the cupboard and the i think they’re perfect.
1946,and i didn’t add the nuts.
1952,can’t wait to make these!
1954,they don’t tear when you use a plastic knife.
1971,do you know why the recipe specifically says to use cold eggs?
1972,i always thought it was better to use room-temperature ingredients when baking so everything gets incorporated easier without stiffening the batter.
1973,i wonder if using cold eggs here creates a different texture than room-temp eggs would.
1974,this recipe inspired me to use the lamaison de chocolat cocoa powder that i have had sitting in my pantry.
1975,i have tried so many brownie recipes and the only one that i have liked as much as this one is the luxury brownie recipe  from chocolateandzucchini.com (i do not include the nuts) http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2009/01/brownies.php
1979,"even at half-and-half, they turned out black as night and because the black onyx is lower in fat, i added a couple more t. of butter."
1982,"“why would you change it?”  if i made them again, i probably would only add a couple t. of the black onyx."
1983,it’s the kind of thing i will probably throw in the pot next time i make chili.
1985,mimi — you should make oreos with that cocoa powder.
1986,i’m nearly positive that the boxed version uses black cocoa.
1988,i think i have my next cooking assignment!
2017,oh and about 1 more cup of sugar (split evenly between brown and white).
2030,i used ghirardelli cocoa i buy in bulk at the health food store.
2037,i used dagoba cocoa.
2038,i used the microwave to heat the butter/ cocoa mixture and it worked out just fine.
2040,"i used mini-muffin pans, greased, to which i delivered heaping scoops of batter using a 1 1/4″ ice cream scoop (i got at the shop in chelsea you’ve previously talked about when i went to visit friends in nyc- i am a dork and wanted a food-related souvenir even though i could easily get this item in the bay area :p )."
2044,"butter, flower, cocoa powder and eggs are things we always have in our cupboard."
2048,i’d probably cut the cocoa by a third or even a half next time.
2049,(i used nestlé toll house cocoa.)
2053,i always always have used nothing but cocoa powder.
2055,"if a recipe calls for melted chocolate, i do the cocoa powder and butter/shortening/ oil route instead."
2066,i even took the shortcut of melting the butter and cocoa mixture using the microwave and they turned out incredibly well.
2082,i substituted the walnuts for chocolate chips and then topped with powdered sugar : ) and i did the microwave route to melt the chocolate and it worked perfect.
2083,"i was wrong, these won’t make it until tomorrow *leers at the three brownies she brought to work* i need to make a double batch next time."
2087,"i used hershey’s special dark like many others, and they were perfectly chocolatey with a unique (to me), almost black color."
2092,"i used droste dutched cocoa, they baked in 25 minutes, and were dark, deep chocolate-y."
2097,"i have a pan in the oven now, using hershey’s special dark cocoa, (looked like coffee grounds after the first step!"
2102,and i didn’t have to go to the store for anything (used pernigotti cocoa powder)!
2113,"i used just a regular grocery store cocoa, but i am living in holland right now and am on the hunt for droste."
2118,"made these yesterday, baked them for 32 minutes and next time i’ll bake them 5 minutes less as they weren’t exactly on the soft side:) i left them at room temperature and cut them today."
2127,i think i will use this recipe for the brownie base and try it with the chevre filling.
2150,i used to go to this place in philadelphia that had giant brownies.
2169,i’ll have to try these sometime- though i’ve been using mary encinger’s brownie recipe which was in the nyt (nov’ 98) and haven’t looked back.
2175,"for the low-carbers and/or gluten-free among us, i made a killer adaptation of these…best lc/sugar-free/gluten-free brownies i’ve ever made."
2176,"i accidentally came into some black cocoa powder, and then this recipe dropped."
2184,i used  about a half cup of green and blacks cocoa and hershey’s for the rest.
2185,"i also no longer keep white sugar in the house, so i used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of turbinado sugar."
2188,i had the durnedest time wrangling the paper into the pan.
2192,there must be an easier way to do this…suggestions?
2205,how funny- this is the exact recipe i use!
2207,"i had to make these, just to see if it was possible to make chocolatey brownies with only cocoa."
2208,"i used droste cocoa and the gram measurements made everything so much easier, fewer utensils to wash!"
2210,"i mixed the butter/cocoa/sugar/salt according to the directions and couldn’t seem to get the mixture hot enough, so i finally put the bowl in the microwave for just a bit."
2212,the brownies are indeed very chocolatey using only cocoa.
2226,"i realized this morning that i forgot the +2 tbsp of cocoa, but it didn’t change much."
2227,i used hershey’s natural dark chocolate.
2228,the only other change i made was to add 1 tsp of instant espresso.
2231,next time i will be more adventurous and try the spiced up ones!
2253,i loved them with walnuts – i used the ones in the shell left over from christmas.
2254,i used a mixture of godiva and herseys.
2260,"i used to be a dedicated browser due to my sister’s recommendation of your site, but lately i have been using more cookbook recipes than online resources."
2261,"due to an intense brownie craving, i used the first cocoa recipe i found and pulled them out of the oven literally a minute before reading this post."
2262,"next time, i will definitely try this one."
2271,originally got them from here: http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/suzannes_best_brownies/ although i used vanilla extract cuz some in my family don’t like almond extract.
2281,i’d bought some high-fat high quality cocoa a while ago and couldn’t use it as often as i wanted… now i know what i’ll be making!
2285,i used 200g of butter as it didn’t seem as runny as yours.
2286,that may be from using partly brown sugar as i ran out of white (horror!)
2290,"i have never made cocoa brownies before, but tried these (using hershey’s) and they are so tasty!"
2296,"these look very doable, and should convert easily to gluten-free."
2309,"ps – i made mine gluten-free with bob’s red mill all-purpose flour mix and no other alterations, lovely!"
2325,great recipe using ingredients i always have on hand.
2326,i’ll try it with droste next time.
2331,"i used the microwave method to melt the butter – worked well, though the bowl was much hotter than i would have liked afterward."
2332,"ok. exactly the same as katherine hepburn’s brownies but more butter (1 stick vs. 1 & 1/4 stick) and 1/2 cup flour instead of 1/4 cup , plus this calls for cocoa powder."
2335,"in other news, i decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added 2 tbsp of strong coffee."
2349,"at the time, my default “easy” recipe was the one i included."
2357,"one thing, i was short about a quarter cup of sugar, but they were definitely plenty sweet for my taste."
2364,"but i tried mimi’s trick (#328) and used half black onyx powder with half raw cacao powder, went gluten-free thanks to paula (#376), used barely a cup of sugar, sea salt on top… incredible!!"
2370,"i substituted most of the butter for coconut oil because we’re almost out of butter, and used whole wheat flour because that’s all we had."
2372,somebody earlier mentioned the lacy coconut topping from bittersweet… that intrigued me so much and i was thrilled to discover that on amazon i could use the “search within the book” function to see a sample page.
2412,"however, next time i’ll be buttering the pan or lining it with parchment paper because the foil struck to the brownies (should have sprayed it…) and is making it extremely difficult to remove without having the brownies split in half."
2413,"i’m making these again for a dinner party tomorrow, but still haven’t gotten any suggestions on the parchment issue (popping out of the pan and sliding around…anyone else have trouble or am i just gimpy?"
2417,that way when you put the batter in and it wants to slip around you have a position for them that will be easier to rest them back into.
2419,i also had to bake them for a good 10-12 mins longer than suggested.
2421,"another way to cut out the vanilla is to use vanilla sugar, made by leaving a split vanilla bean in a jar of sugar for a week or two (or longer and keep refilling the jar)."
2424,just a question – has anyone tried making the brownies with agave syrup instead of sugar?
2426,"deb, thank you for the suggestions :)  didn’t mean to sound demanding, just a little panicked about the impending paper struggle."
2427,i used the corners tip and the paper stayed put!
2433,this last time i added some chopped chocolate chunks to the batter.
2446,"as previously commented, i also used “dark” cocoa powder–the results were delicous!"
2465,this recipe looks a little easier though!
2474,i cut the sugar down to 1 cup.
2475,"if you’re serving this to people who prefer chocolate over sugar, then 1 cup is enough sugar."
2476,"i think if i make this again, i’ll keep the original amount."
2480,"i’ve never made brownies with cocoa powder before (i used hershey’s), but these were surprisingly good and easy to make."
2490,has anyone tried making them vegan?
2491,i’d like to try this replacing butter with oil and egg with flax seed.
2510,"also, btw (for those of you who are interested) didn’t use any vanilla extract because i didn’t have any in the house, used room-temperature eggs and also only had one brand of ordinary cocoa so had to use that."
2519,"i winged the measurements (uk based, scales had run out of battery and only had some cup measures) and only had a much bigger than suggested baking pan."
2538,i used hershey’s cocoa (don’t ask how long it was sitting in my cupboard) and they are divine.
2540,i’ve made these about 5 times since the recipe was posted and it has replaced the baked brownie in my house.
2554,is there any chance of using oil in this recipe instead of the butter?
2557,"for anyone who commented about veganising these, they are way easier to veganise than normal brownies."
2558,"brownies using chocolate need lecithin to bind the whole mix together, i don’t use eggs in my cooking so whenever i replaced the eggs in those recipes with a powdered egg replacer, like ener-g, they didn’t work."
2560,"these use cocoa, and have a lower fat content so a powdered egg replacer or anything you usually use in cakes, etc."
2563,or just use tofu.
2568,hi deb.. just wanted to tell you your fantastic :) at the risk of sounding lazy … has anyone tried having the mixture beaten using the mixer instead of a wooden spoon?
2569,"and if one were to use the wooden spoon, is the 40 strokes crucial?"
2574,i was just discussion on a forum with someone about the virtues of flavour with chocolate when it contains cocoa butter as in a good bar of choc or like in this recipe just using 100% cocoa….i remembered seeing this post of yours a while back
2582,i followed the instructions fairly precisely (i think i left out one tablespoon of cocoa powder but i don’t think that should have been make-or break.
2588,i used hazelnuts instead of walnuts.
2605,"tried with no nuts, instead adding 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cayenne."
2609,"less bitter and more wonderful — laurie colwin once wrote an essay about a chocolate dessert that improved greatly after sitting for a few days (and see today’s feed me piece in the nyt about brownies, which suggests the same)."
2615,"i baked these 27 minutes, until an inserted toothpick came out with just a little bit of batter, but now i think they probably could’ve used another 5 minutes in the oven."
2619,"i reduced the sugar a little and increased the quantities by 50% because my baking dish was too big, and baked them for about 30 minutes."
2626,im from india and am a vegetarian.
2628,i have managed to find an egg replacement (u  know the powdered stuff that comes) after a lot of searching.
2631,pls gimme ure opinion on the replacement.. ive never used it and m hoping it works reasonably well.
2648,"made with hershey’s cocoa,  i used the microwave instead of the double boiler method, and a silicone spatula rather than a wooden spoon."
2653,"i made a few modifications: i added 3 medium size eggs instead of 2 large ones, i used 145g butter, 90g cocoa and i put it in a slightly smaller dish and baked for 10 mins on bake then 7 or so on fan bake."
2662,"forgot to mention i added 3 t. of finely ground deep-roasted coffee and the result was, as mentioned, superb!"
2667,i used dutch processed cococa but i plan to use natural cocoa next time to see the difference.
2677,"today, i was out of granulated sugar, so i tried out using 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar."
2678,"before even adding flour, the batter was thick and dough-like, so i used only 1/4 cup of flour."
2683,i was missing the vanilla but substituted it with almond flavoring then added some marzipan on top to keep the theme.
2689,i do have to add that i have found that scharffen berger cacao nibs are a spectacular addition in place of nuts.
2691,"i used a high fat dutch processed cocoa from penzys, which was fantastic."
2696,can i use hershey’s special dark cocoa in this?
2697,i’m dying to make it but i’m not sure if my available cocoa would be okay for this.
2698,do i need to adjust the measurement if i use it?
2701,always use cocoa but i do find brownies to be tricky and as i’m not a fan of the boxed type we do not have brownies often.
2709,"this passover i was forced to figure out that you can make any chocolatey thing way better with cocoa instead if you cook it up in a sugar syrup first, use way too much butter and almond meal."
2711,"i didn’t have any cocoa for some reason, but really wanted to make these…what i did have though was some natural hot chocolate mix, which was basically cocoa and sugar with lavender and orange extract."
2712,i omitted the quarter cup of sugar and it turned out delicious…yum!
2726,"i’m currently dairy and soy free (baby boy has an allergy), so the first time i subbed out oil (safflower) for the butter."
2728,the next 2 times i continued to sub out the butter (i miss baking with butter!)
2729,"and subbed 50% brown sugar for granulated sugar (and added a couple of tablespoons), to give a bit of a stronger flavour."
2731,i should add – i used a stand mixer to make these and i didn’t heat anything (since the oil doesn’t need to be melted).
2732,"also, i didn’t use nuts (not a fan in brownies)."
2737,":) i made a few very small changes and included a post on them in my blog, and would like to link to your picture of the “gritty” stage."
2738,"i’ve included links to your main page and to this recipe, and given the link to your photo credit, but please please please let me know if you would like me to remove the link for any reason."
2750,i made it for my friend and she doesn’t like dark chocolate so i added 1/4 cup more sugar so 1 and 1/2 cup altogether and i also added milk chocolate in the batter so there’s chocolate “surprise.” i wanted to try sea salt instead of normal salt and it was a bit salty so i”ll  stick to normal salt next time or just use 1/8 teaspoon for sea salt.
2754,i added fluer de sel because i used margarine.
2755,i am sure someone is laughing i used these together.
2763,is there any tip/trick you use to get your brownies so flat?
2775,instead of slicing bake and forth with a serrated knife to cut through the crusty top layer i decided to press the knife in instead and it cut them into perfect little squares!
2782,i’ll never use another recipe.
2789,"i used the microwave method mentioned in another comment to melt the sugar, butter and cocoa and i worked wonderfully!"
2794,i increased everything to a 3 egg mix and after the 3rd egg it split.
2795,i can only think that my butter had too much water in it from the freezer or i used too much.
2798,i’ll make these again and again!
2800,"btw i skipped the “set the bowl in a wide skillet of barely simmering water” part and just used a heavy saucepan on low heat, turned out fine."
2805,"this time i added a dash of cinnamon, a half teaspoon of cappucino flavored instant coffee granules, and a mix of peanut butter and milk chocolate chips, oh my!!!"
2810,perfect texture throughout instead of crunchy on the outside and soggy in the middle.
2826,"i hope that more americans start cooking this way, it’s so much easier- and makes for much less cleaning!"
2833,"this time,  added some chipotle/cayenne for some spice."
2836,i made these today and had only white whole wheat flour in the house so i used it and they are excellent.
2837,added a little cayenne for kick and used one cup coconut palm sugar which is also the only sugar i had in the house and wow.
2844,"they add 2 extra tbsp of the cocoa, double the vanilla to 1 tsp, use a little less flour (1/3 c + 1tbsp, or 48.6 g), and brown the butter before adding the cocoa, sugar, vanilla, and salt."
2849,"i used two eggs but my batter didn´t look shinny like yours, it still looked grittled and i´m thinking it´s the egg, please help!"
2851,"i scaled this up for a 9×9 pan because that’s all i had, and thought i’d share the measurements in case anyone else wants to do it that way —- 12.5 tbsp/176 g butter; 350 g sugar; 102.5 g cocoa; 1/3 tsp salt; 5/8 tsp vanilla; 2 extra-large or jumbo eggs; 82.5 g all-purpose flour; 3/4 c nuts."
2870,i added a pinch each of cayenne and generic “chili powder” and used the flaky sea salt tip.
2872,i was a tiny bit low on cocoa so i added less than an ounce of baking chocolate to the melted mixture.
2882,do you think that the substitution of butter-flavored shortening for butter will affect the brownies?
2896,i will have to keep a tin of cocoa powder in my pantry at all times just so i can make these whenever the mood strikes.
2898,"i just have to make these brownies, so i have ordered valhrona cocoa powder and have a question:  i ordered online, and the seller suggested the cocoa powder be put in a heat protection bag…does that mean that i should keep this in the fridge?"
2913,someone in the comments of my current post said something about swapping half potato starch and half matzo cake meal for the flour in this recipe and finding it to be delicious.
2926,i used maldon salt (1/2 tsp) and droste cocoa powder.
2940,i would recomend decreasing the sugar to 1 cup if adding a layer of frosting.
2959,"these brownies were verrry good, and i only needed to use one bowl for the batter!"
2960,"next time, i would up the salt content because that’s just how i like it, and, though i added walnuts to this batch, i think i would omit them next time."
2961,"i might also experiment with the sugar content, try reducing it by 1/4 c just because the cocoa’s so dang good!"
2962,"for the sake of transparency, i did use some high quality e guittard dutch-process cocoa."
2986,i’ll sub the white sugar for brown and maybe add a few of these mint chips to half and see what happens!
2996,will definitely use again and again.
2998,"im about to make these now, with chocolate extract instead of essence and dark brown sugar because i don’t have any white.. they’re going to be intense!"
3010,"made these with coconut oil instead of butter (minus a few tablespoons), a splash of milk to compensate for the moisture, and mint extract instead of vanilla."
3013,i am going to use these over all of my other brownie recipes from now on.
3030,i’ve made these brownies a few times with gluten-free flour and they are excellent.
3046,"btw, i’ve been using callebaut belgian chocolate (dutched; 22-24% fat, on line from worldwidechocolate.com for $26.95 a kilo–2.2 #."
3048,"valhrona is also available from this source for about $1.00 more; now that i’ve read everyone’s comments, i’m going to order this cocoa powder next time."
3054,if i use a convection oven do i reduce the temperature to 300 degrees since there is a lot of sugar in this.
3056,"i needed to make a couple of time/temperature adjustments (340 degrees and about 40 minutes), but they came out just awesome."
3080,"in mine though, i used dark chocolate cocoa powder (hersheys special dark)."
3081,"personally, i loved them this way, but do you think they’d taste better with regular cocoa powder?"
3082,"the dutch process cocoa is particularly hard to find, so usually all i have on hand is regular cocoa."
3083,do they taste the same/better with regular?
3096,whoops forgot the link:
3111,"just messed up on these and accidentally used 2 tbsp or so of cinnamon instead of the extra 2 tbsp of cocoa powder, substituted powdered sugar for about half of the asked-for sugar, and used rosewater instead of vanilla."
3114,this is awesome recipe i use all the time!!
3122,i added some mini-chips instead of the nuts.
3128,i’m totally going to have to change my shirt before i go because this one is covered in cocoa powder.
3134,";) ahhhh, i might just need to make some more of these next week!"
3140,"by the time i added the last egg, and then the flour, it was amazing!"
3151,i think you could probably reduce the sugar a little and they would still be just as good.
3161,only one thing i always change in your sweet recipe is to cut the sugar down about 30%.
3162,"in this case, i used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups and added unsweetened shredded coconuts."
3177,"made these with coconut oil instead of butter (minus a few tablespoons), a splash of milk to compensate for the moisture, and mint extract instead of vanilla."
3188,"just tried melting the butter in a heavy bottom pan, then adding the sugar, cocoa & salt directly into the pan…eventually cooling a bit and adding the rest of the ingredients, so no bowl at all."
3192,"using dark brown sugar, and added 2 tsp ginger, 1.5 tsp cinnamon and .25 tsp cloves, and voila!"
3197,i bought some valrhona cocoa powder recently and was chomping at the bit for something to do with it.
3230,"i actually tried subscribing to the rss feed, but had a problem including it as a result will must make an effort once more at some point."
3234,i have been looking for a good brownie recipe using cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate.
3237,"oh my, that’s a lot of comments… i just wanted to add my thanks to the rest for posting this recipe – it’s now my go-to brownie recipe – and to report that i’ve tried both doubling the recipe for a 9×13 pan (it worked fine, but i don’t remember if i had to increase the baking time – probably yes), and that i’ve made them gluten free by substituting an equal weight of sorghum flour for the ap flour – and no one who tried them could tell!"
3245,"a couple small adjustments that may help other readers: 1) lining the pan while waiting for the butter/cocoa/sugar mixture to cool after microwaving saved a few minutes (i was pressed for time), 2) adding half a bag of chocolate chips instead of nuts was a delicious addition, and 3) i doubled the recipe in a 9×13 pan for 35 minutes, and only had a 150 gram bag of cocoa (missing about 1/4 cup) – and the brownies still came out great."
3251,i was trying to be a little ambitious today instead of making my standby banana bread.they turned out amazing.
3255,"also, i used ghiradelli cocoa powder."
3266,i used the microwave method for melting and used regular old hersheys cocoa and they are great.
3267,if you use the microwave method they are one bowl brownies too!
3277,"instead of nuts, i added 2/3 cup of organic shredded coconut, and instead of vanilla (i was all out) i added a few drops of pure almond extract."
3284,"i’ve been making this recipe for years, but i was wondering–would this recipe work with the white chocolate brownie recipe you use for the white and dark hearted brownies, or is there a difference in brownie height between the two recipes?"
3295,"i also served them with a chunky peanut butter frosting (quarter cup soft butter, quarter cup chunky pb, 3/4 cup powdered sugar and a tablespoon of milk)."
3301,"i was out of cocoa, so i used the chocolate squares and a bit less butter to compensate for the extra fat in the baking squares."
3306,just wanted to say for the record that these work beautifully with bob’s red mill gluten free all-purpose flour.
3309,can i use himalayan salt for these?
3312,"every time i make these brownies, i add 1/4 cup sugar and bake them for 35 minutes."
3316,"here’s what i had to do when i didn’t have: * enough cocoa – just had 64grams, so i added 30grams of chocolate (65%) and left out a tbsp of butter; * vanilla – put some cinammon in for flavor and then remembered it should have been something liquidy and put 1/2 tsp whiskey, too; * enough nuts – i only had about 40 grams of hazelnuts and put them in; * a proper pan – mine are all either too small or too big, so i used 2 – one 6×6 inch and one 7×4."
3320,to make them extra chocolaty i added a half teaspoon of espresso powder.
3326,i also ran out of cocoa and added 2 tbsp of coffee instead.
3339,maybe less flour because there’s a lot of cocoa powder in it.
3341,i used hazelnuts instead but only half of the recipe and added chocolate chips.
3348,please can you tell us where exactly you changed the recipe?
3351,hi anna — i usually clarify where i’ve made a change (i.e.
3352,“i used flaky salt” etc.)
3359,"i forgot to say, i love the ‘surprise me’ button."
3362,can’t believe it’s just cocoa powder in them!
3363,i ran out of normal sugar so i used 80g on dark brown soft sugar instead and it worked perfectly.
3371,"i used literally the cheapest possible storebrand cocoa and did all of the melting in the microwave, and they still came out wonderfully."
3380,"i have started with the recipe as it was and then tried to make it a bit healthier, by swapping the flour for almond meal, and reducing the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, only because we have been eating so many!!"
3388,i had to make quite a few substitutions based on what i had on hand.
3389,i substituted half the butter for coconut oil and usued whole wheat flour plus about 2 tbs of water for the apf.
3390,"also i used one medium chicken egg, one small pigeon egg (my house mate raises king pigeons), and half a mashed banana instead of two large eggs and i substituted the last 1/4 cup of sugar for agave nectar."
3394,they were somewhat thin b/c i used a 9 x 11inch pan.
3396,"hi thanks for this recipe i have been searching for a cocoa brownies recipe but one question, can i use cake flour?"
3399,make sure it isn’t self-rising cake flour.
3402,even my husband — who thinks baking from scratch is a waste of time since box mixes are so much easier — was impressed.
3410,"i just made these (had intense chocolate craving but lacked some necessary ingredients) with substitutions of 1/2 cup honey, 2/3 cup japanese sweet potato (baked then mashed a bit) for the sugar, and 1/2 cup almond meal + 1/2 tsp baking powder subbed for the flour."
3411,i only used one egg so i also minimized the butter and cocoa to 6 tbsp butter and 2/3 cup cocoa.
3413,"i made them just as the recipe says, only used the microwave instead of the stove, and they took about 30 minutes in the oven."
3426,next time.
3436,they were easy and used ingredients that most people always have on hand.
3437,i used hershey’s “special dark” cocoa powder.
3439,i used white whole wheat flour (which i almost always use instead of all purpose) and i did not add any nuts.
3448,thank you for including the weights.
3462,i left out the salt (as i usually do) and baked them for 35 minutes.
3472,"the butter at 141 is correct, the sugar is a little high, should be 250. i have a super hard time getting a good read on cocoa powder."
3473,"most people would say that it is 85 grams a cup, so it would be too high here, but i get much more when i use my valrhona cocoa, because it’s so rich."
3475,"i will adjust the sugar and the cocoa, with a note."
3489,i tried this recipe a couple weeks back and forgot to write and say how amazing it was.
3514,they are so easy to whip up – dare i say easier even than a mix?
3517,"this recipe lends itself perfectly to bob’s gluten free flour, a product i have had only mild success with."
3519,no one guessed i made them gluten-free.
3522,"my go-to brownie recipe (cocoa brownies) has a complete different ratio of cocoa to flour, 1/2 c cocoa to 3/4 c flour and they’re really chocolately good so i can’t imagine what this recipe would be like!"
3525,i used hershey’s special dark cocoa and they are so rich and not too sweet – fantastic.
3529,i just whipped up a batch for last minute guest which include 3 teenage nephews and i know they will be devoured.
3535,my kitchen is warm enough that coconut oil is liquid at room temp so i sometimes swap out the butter for 4 oz coconut oil.
3536,you won’t miss the butter and they’re just that much easier to whip up on a whim.
3538,used dutch processed cocoa (for the first time) and made no changes at all to the recipe.
3573,"i found a peanut butter cookie dough brownie recipe on the food network site (which is divine by the way, you should look it up), and i used your brownie recipe instead of that one for the brownie part…best brownies i’ve ever had, seriously."
3574,and i love how easy this recipe is too- i use my microwave for the first part and it works like a charm.
3575,"oh and, i don’t have an 8x8 pan, so i always double the recipe and use my 9×13 pan…i think even if i did have an 8×8 pan, i’d still double the recipe ;)"
3585,also used king arthur flour ‘double-dutch’ dark cocoa (a mix of dutch process and black cocoa) which gives them a wonderful color.
3587,"they’re so easy, and i love that you only use cocoa powder."
3596,;) i accidentally used self-raising flour a couple of thimes and the result was a lovely crunchy top and still gooey in the middle.
3597,sometimes now i use sr flour on purpose.
3598,"forgot to say, i use all different things in them."
3599,sometimes i add instant coffee.
3604,"i adore a good brownie and was relying on a cook’s illustrated recipe for a brownie that tastes like the box.however, this recipe is much more streamlined and, frankly, easier."
3610,"ive been using this recipe for years, i make thousands every year."
3621,"they were yummm…the mistake i made was, that i added in 3 times the quantity of the flour mentioned in the recipe and then to mend it added 200gms of dark chocolate and milk to liquify them..the brownies were delectably chewy and sinfully chocolatey…love this recipe :) my favourite from here on..!!"
3637,"a really easy recipe, and definitely one i will use again."
3656,their ok but nothing i would crave and i used decent coco which was a bit of a waste as i’m not going to eat them.
3660,i will use only one egg next time and more moisture of some sort.
3661,"also, instead of the whopping 1-1/4 cups of sugar i used 3/4 c and they are perfectly sweetened against the special dark cocoa that i used."
3663,i added a little bit of milk though (and a tiny bit more flour to even out the consistency) to make it more moist.
3674,i wonder how half the flour compares!
3675,i would like to make these for someone who is lactose intolerant…does anyone have some suggestions for butter substitutes.
3677,maybe hydrogenated coconut oil?
3687,"i’ve made these as written for my family before, but i am catering a gluten free bridal shower this weekend and brownie bites were requested."
3688,"well…i made these with my gluten free flour blend (my recipe) and topped with some grand marnier ganache, cut into circles and holy schamoly!"
3695,"i’ve rarely used anything but cocoa powder (ghirardelli extra dark) in my recipes, so i don’t even know what a brownie made w/ choc bar tastes like."
3698,"the different is in the mixing of the dry sugar, cocoa and salt with the butter."
3699,"the other recipe belts the butter and mixes the sugar, cocoa and salt and then pours the melted butter into this dry mix."
3704,"it might be easier if i know where their recipe came from, though i suspect alice medrich as well as these are her classic creation."
3708,i always reduce the sugar and add in shredded or flaked coconut.
3726,completely delicious and just as good as chocolate :) although i might recommend using a little less butter since my sister and i spend about 10minutes dabbing melted butter from the brownies!
3742,could not have been easier to make!
3743,i also cut the sugar by half a cup and added more walnuts as i love lots of nuts.
3745,"i use van houten dutch process cocoa, they’re black as pitch and incredibly chocolatey."
3749,"last night, i ran out of butter and ended up substituting with 4 tablespoons of oil and 4.5 tablespoons of applesauce."
3772,the second batch (fresh out of the oven) i doubled and used a nine inch pan.
3781,"the good news is that i know both work well, though i have only used this one."
3787,"i substituted coconut oil for the butter (major dairy allergy) which gave the baking aroma a hint of mounds bars, but faded to almost unnoticeable as they cooled."
3793,needless to say i washed and saved those little squares of foil because sooner or later they are going to get used again – probably tomorrow ;-)
3798,am making the chocolate sugar cookie recipe from cook’s country (april 2013) and need 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.
3802,"and stranger, the scharffen berger suggests 3 tab cocoa plus 1 tab sugar per 8 oz cocoa drink and the ghiardelli suggests 1.5 tab each cocoa and sugar per 8 oz."
3806,only cocoa.
3814,"made these and they were scrum, i normally use a recipe that yields 300g of chocolate so i thought i’d try something diff and these taste exactly the same, and the mixture is way tastier to gobble!"
3822,any suggestions about how to package it?
3828,"after i added an egg to my cooled cocoa mixture, the batter suddenly separated into an almost clear liquid and a thick glob of batter and it’s so thick i can’t even mix it!"
3836,"here in my place we were not used to baked dishes, recently i bought an otg to try baking cakes at home."
3878,"a month and a half or so ago, i was merely looking for a very simple brownie recipe that used cocoa instead of chocolate."
3885,"okay, i didn’t realize it at the time of posting the other night, but i had inadvertently left the flour out of these (it was late and i was tired and in a hurry to make them for the husband’s lunch)."
3890,"(added about 1/3 cup of cold, very strong coffee tonight and a wee bit more flour to make up for the extra liquid.)"
3895,after almost two years since i tried this recipe for the first time… i just wanted to add that when you substitute ordinary flour with potato or tapioca starch you get equally delicious gluten-free brownies.
3899,obviously some chemistry didn’t work out right with the substitution!
3900,might have to try again with some other sugar replacement.
3907,"i think i would add it with the butter, sugar, cocoa , and salt."
3923,"i was on your site at two in the morning (instead of in bed where all decent people should be at that time), and i came across these babies."
3929,is that the same as flaky sea salt and can i still use it in this recipe?
3930,hi diane — i’d use half to be safe.
3939,i use hershey’s special dark.
3963,i used callebaut cocoa powder which is what i use for all of my cakes and brownies.
3967,i added bourbon into the batter to make them bourbon-flavoured but the batter ended up being a little too runny… will adding more flour help to unfudgey-fy the brownies?
3975,has anyone tried it with spelt flour instead of the apf?
3977,i added bourbon into the batter to make them bourbon-flavoured but the batter ended up being a little too runny… will adding more flour help to unfudgey-fy the brownies?
3985,other commentators have stated they used coconut oil 1:1 and it was fine.
3986,my problem happens when i add the eggs.
4005,"she has helped me make them each time, and we have used white ww flour, swapped half the butter for unsweetened applesauce, and cut the sugar to 1 cup, so she can tell her teacher she has made “marginally healthier brownies”!"
4015,used 1 c sugar and baked in a 8 x 6 glass pyrex (tupperware!).
4029,"(i don’t eat refined sugar or wheat, so i’m debating about playing around with this recipe using coconut palm sugar and almond flour.)"
4031,"but i thought i’d mention that these brownies work very, very well with all purpose gluten-free flour."
4032,"they’re naturally fudgy and dense and with only 1/2 cup of flour, you barely notice the difference."
4037,i substituted with wholemeal flour and olive butter and even reduced the sugar but it was still heavenly tasting and perfectly moist inside!
4041,"well, what’s left after i licked the spoon and the bowl…  i had a 9×9 pan, and made these adjustments:  157 g butter, 281 g sugar, 73 g cocoa, 73 g flour, and 45 g pistachios + 45 g dried cherries."
4052,hi deb–i’m thinking of using condensed milk instead of sugar.
4053,"do i still have to use the same amount, or do i put in half of it instead, given how sweet it is?"
4054,"ive baked your recipe…trully its the best…but i have a question…before i follow all the listed ingredient, but for now, im a bit out of stock in my pantry having butter… can i use margarine, instead?"
4055,"if i can, can you help me for the measurement to use?"
4056,you can make these with the same amount of margarine.
4060,"microwave way worked, but to melt the sugars and coco powder, over the heat left much silkier texture to the batter."
4063,"making second batch now, but i might have used little bit more butter than i should have."
4072,chocolate is one of the most enjoyable and effective ways to medicate.full melt chocolates are organic fair trade premier brand of medicated chocolate bars.full melt offers a variety of fun and delicious flavors to choose from including both plain milk and dark chocolate bars for those who want to experience the true flavor of cannabis.
4078,i am not sure how this will turn out because i have mistakenly put 1 heaping teaspoon of salt instead 1/4 heaping tea spoon in this recipe….:(.
4087,"i do half the amount of butter, and substitute the other half for coconut oil."
4106,i melted the butter in the microwave (i didn’t see the point in using a double boiler just to melt butter…) and baked them for 30-35 minutes.
4120,"i’ve made these a few times, the last two times i’ve made them as the recipe states, but i’ve used a cupcake tin so as to have easy individual servings."
4127,the recipe that i need without using chocolate chips or bars but stays true to being a chocolatey brownie.
4131,"if you use a plastic knife while they’re still warm, and use a soft sawing motion, you can cut them easily without warm brownie sticking to the knife."
4164,"what is very interesting is that they’re cheaper and easier to make too : )  thank you very much for sharing and for your metric measurements (although we do use cups in ireland too, i prefer metric."
4176,can i switch the butter with vegetable oil?
4178,"shari — i haven’t made these with anything but butter, but a bunch of people have commented about using coconut oil without any trouble."
4182,hello  i used dark chocolate and it came out bitter !
4187,"marie — there isn’t any dark chocolate in this recipe, just unsweetened cocoa powder."
4188,is that what you used?
4194,i added walnuts and everyone loved them including my very fussy husband who hates anything too chocolatey.
4212,this time i decide to double it and use it as base for marbled cheesecake brownies.
4216,i make these frequently.
4217,different variations include cinnamon and adding a little extra salt on the top.
4219,cakey substitutes need not make a showing.
4230,and b) would i replace the vanilla extract with peppermint extract or would you suggest another method?
4243,i had to try to finish it since i used my good cocoa powder.
4244,"alexandra — sure, i’d just swap out the vanilla, but maybe just half and then taste it before adding the other half."
4250,is it for ease of removing the brownies from the pan to cut?
4252,sandy — it’s for ease of removal; i’m sorry that it didn’t help!
4258,"i made these yesterday with about 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil, subbed in 1/2 c coconut sugar for some of the regular sugar and used white whole wheat flour."
4272,i made these using oil instead of butter for someone with a dairy allergy and i’m happy to say that they turned out great!
4280,"fyi to other users, i used ghiradelli cocoa powder."
4283,sometimes i add a bit of chocolate chips and it adds an extra crunch.
4288,used microwave to melt butter with sugar and cocoa.
4292,"i’ve made these brownies a few times now, and the last time i made them they were the best brownies i’d ever eaten: i used half normal cocoa powder, half black cocoa powder."
4295,next time i might experiment with full-black cocoa powder.
4306,"less sugar, a little addition of brown sugar and coconut oil."
4313,"anyway, quadrupled quantities are 5 sticks of butter, 5 c sugar, 1 t salt, 2 t vanilla, 8 eggs, 4 c flour."
4326,"so, that is the cocoa powder that i used in these awesome brownies."
4329,"hi, do you think this recipe would work if fully or partially substituting cocoa butter for the regular butter?"
4337,i use hershey’s special dark cocoa.
4345,"i used a 9″ square cake pan, and there was so little batter that they were barely a half-inch tall."
4346,using the 8″ pan recommended would not have solved this problem.
4351,using an 8 inch pan would definitely make the brownies thicker.
4356,"i followed the recipe faithfully, except that i used one cup of granulated brown sugar and a quarter cup of white."
4364,why don’t you make the recipe easier to print out?
4386,"i used vegan butter and aquafaba to replace the butter and eggs and they still developed that rich, fudgy texture."
4398,"i use either droste or penzeys dutch processed cocoa to achieve a rich, chocolatey taste."
