I decided to use it as a stand-in for salad dressing in this hearty salad, a simple combination of cooked Israeli couscous and beans. I used canned pinto beans, and they were just fine. Chickpeas would also work. Use lots of basil in the mix. The red onion contributes some crunch. You can add a little celery if you want more texture. Make sure to use sweet, ripe, juicy tomatoes. I love the finishing touch of the feta, but it is optional.</p>\\n<p class=\"related-article\">\\n<span class=\"label\">Featured in: </span>\\n<a

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid. Let sit for 10 minutes.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\"recipe-user-notes collapsed-state hidden\"></div>\\n<div class=\"secondary-controls\">\\n<span class=\"header\">Like this

balsamic vinegar and basil serve as both dressing and vegetable in this main dish salad.</p><p>I\\u2019ve been making tomato concass\\xe9e all summer and using it as a sauce for pasta and fish. I decided to use it as a stand-in for salad dressing in this hearty salad, a simple combination of cooked Israeli couscous and beans. I used canned pinto beans, and they were just fine. Chickpeas would also work. Use lots of basil in the mix. The red onion contributes some crunch. You can add a little celery if you want more texture. Make sure to use sweet, ripe, juicy tomatoes. I love the finishing touch of the feta, but it is optional.</p>\\n<p class=\"related-article\">\\n<span class=\"label\">Featured in: </span>\\n<a

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid.

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid.

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid. Let sit for 10 minutes.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\"recipe-user-notes collapsed-state hidden\"></div>\\n<div class=\"secondary-controls\">\\n<span class=\"header\">Like this recipe?</span>\\n<div class=\"controls detail-controls recipe-detail-controls\">\\n<div class=\"save-group\">\\n<div class=\"save-group-front\" data-regi-placement=\"bottom\">\\n<span class=\"icon icon-save-white\"></span>\\n     Save To Recipe Box\\n   </div>\\n<div class=\"save-organize-container\">\\n<div class=\"save btn\" data-regi-placement=\"bottom\">\\n<span class=\"icon icon-save-white\"></span>\\n<span class=\"icon icon-save-white\"></span>\\n<span class=\"recipe-save\">Save</span>\\n<span class=\"recipe-saved\">Saved</span>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"organize btn tooltip\" data-regi-placement=\"bottom\"><span class=\"icon icon-organize-white\">Add to a collection</span>\\n<div class=\"add-to-collections tooltip-content\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"print share-btn icon icon-bubble-print\" data-platform=\"Print\" href=\"javascript:window.print()\">Print this recipe</a>\\n<div class=\"share-group share-bubbles recipe-details-share\">\\n<a class=\"btn share-btn icon facebook icon-bubble-fb\" data-platform=\"Facebook\" data-role=\"share-button\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016788-israeli-couscous-bean-and-tomato-salad\" target=\"_blank\">Share on Facebook</a><!--\\n--><a class=\"btn share-btn icon pinterest icon-bubble-pinterest\" data-platform=\"Pinterest\" data-role=\"share-button\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016788-israeli-couscous-bean-and-tomato-salad&amp;description=NYT%20Cooking:%20Finely%20chopped%20tomatoes%20seasoned%20with%20garlic,%20balsamic%20vinegar%20and%20basil%20serve%20as%20both%20dressing%20and%20vegetable%20in%20this%20main%20dish%20salad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I\\u2019ve%20been%20making%20tomato%20concass\\xe9e%20all%20summer%20and%20using%20it%20as%20a%20sauce%20for%20pasta%20and%20fish.%20I%20decided%20to%20use%20it%20as%20a%20stand-in%20for%20salad%20dressing%20in%20this%20hearty%20salad,%20a%20simple%20combination%20of%20cooked%20Israeli%20couscous%20and%20beans.%20I%20used...&amp;media=https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/02/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-verticalTwoByThree735-v2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Share on Pinterest</a><!--\\n--><a class=\"btn share-btn icon twitter icon-bubble-twitter\" data-platform=\"Twitter\" data-role=\"share-button\" href=\"http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Israeli%20Couscous,%20Bean%20and%20Tomato%20Salad&amp;url=http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016788-israeli-couscous-bean-and-tomato-salad&amp;hashtags=NYTCooking\" target=\"_blank\">Share on Twitter</a><!--\\n--><a class=\"btn share-btn icon email icon-bubble-email\" data-platform=\"Email\" data-role=\"share-button\" href=\"mailto:?subject=NYT%20Cooking:%20Israeli%20Couscous,%20Bean%20and%20Tomato%20Salad&amp;body=NYT%20Cooking:%20Israeli%20Couscous,%20Bean%20and%20Tomato%20Salad%0A%0Ahttp://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016788-israeli-couscous-bean-and-tomato-salad%3Futm_source%3Dsharetools%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dwebsite\" target=\"_blank\">Email</a>\\n</div> <!-- /.share-group -->\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</section> <!-- /.recipe-steps -->\\n</div> <!-- /.recipe-instructions -->\\n</article> <!-- /.card.static.noclickarea -->\\n</div>,\n",

I love the finishing touch of the feta, but it is optional.</p>\\n<p class=\"related-article\">\\n<span class=\"label\">Featured in: </span>\\n<a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/couscous-salads-big-bowls-and-casseroles/\">Couscous Salads, Big Bowls And Casseroles</a>.\\xa0\\n  </p> <!-- /.related-article -->\\n<p class=\"linked-guide\">\\n<span class=\"icon-learn-to-cook-icon-red\"></span>\\n<span class=\"recipe-guide-text\">Learn: <a class=\"recipe-guide-link\" href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/21-how-to-cook-beans\">How to Cook Beans</a></span>\\n</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid.

       "  'tips': u'\\n\\nTo cook Israeli couscous: Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the couscous. Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid. Let sit for 10 minutes.\\n\\n',\n",

fish. I decided to use it as a stand-in for salad dressing in this hearty salad, a simple combination of cooked Israeli couscous and beans. I used canned pinto beans, and they were just fine. Chickpeas would also work. Use lots of basil in the mix. The red onion contributes some crunch. You can add a little celery if you want more texture. Make sure to use sweet, ripe, juicy tomatoes. I love the finishing touch of the feta, but it is optional.</p>\\n<p class=\"related-article\">\\n<span class=\"label\">Featured in: </span>\\n<a

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid.

I decided to use it as a stand-in for salad dressing in this hearty salad, a simple combination of cooked Israeli couscous and beans. I used canned pinto beans, and they were just fine. Chickpeas would also work. Use lots of basil in the mix. The red onion contributes some crunch. You can add a little celery if you want more texture. Make sure to use sweet, ripe, juicy tomatoes.

Toast the couscous, shaking the pan or stirring often, until it colors very lightly and smells aromatic and toasty, a bit like popcorn. Immediately add 2 quarts water and salt to taste (be generous, as if you are cooking pasta) and boil 10 minutes, until the couscous is al dente; it should not be mushy and there should still be plenty of water in the pot. Drain through a strainer and rinse with cold water. Tap the strainer against the sink to drain well, then return the couscous to the pot, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, and return the lid. Let sit for 10 minutes.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\"recipe-user-notes collapsed-state hidden\"></div>\\n<div class=\"secondary-controls\">\\n<span class=\"header\">Like this

I don\\u2019t get the wooden spoon thing either.  I never use one.  They\\u2019re impossible to clean, and I don\\u2019t like the idea of things soaking in to them that really need to be washed away (like oils that can go rancid).  Gross.

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>OK, well that got me wondering, and a bit of help from the old Google got me this answer (buried deep in the Nestle website on a page that seems no longer current but that google does have a cache for \\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nestle.com/NutritionHealthAndWellness/Cooking/AskGilla/CookingTips/Wooden+spoons.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nestle.com/NutritionHealthAndWellness/Cooking/AskGilla/CookingTips/Wooden+spoons.htm</a>):</p>\\n<p>Question:<br/>\\nWhy do you have to use a wooden spoon to stir certain cookie recipes?<br/>\\nAnswer:<br/>\\nHello Jeni,<br/>\\nThere are basically two reasons why a recipe would specify the use of a wooden spoon, the first is mechanical, the second chemical.<br/>\\nWooden spoons are rounded, smooth, relatively soft and non-abrasive. This means that they are comfortable to hold when applying pressure to beat a mixture. The action of a wooden spoon is to push the ingredients together until they are blended. Metal spoons are harder and sharper, with an action which tends to cut through the mixture. This is ideal for folding in ingredients that do not want over mixing such as adding flour to a creamed mixture or folding in egg whites. The design of metal spoons do not make them very comfortable for the cook when hard beating is required and the hard, sharp edges of the spoon may cut or damage ingredients or the mixing bowl.<br/>\\nThe other reason that wood is cited is that it is an unreactive material and is unlikely to react with the ingredients in the mixture. Metal is more reactive, particularly with acidic ingredients, and is not suitable for use in some cases. Plastic \\u2018wooden\\u2019 spoons can often be used in place of wooden spoons, but it is important to be sure that a plastic spoon is heat resistant before using it for a hot preparation.<br/>\\nWooden spoons are an important utensil in the kitchen and most good cooks and chefs would not be without one!<br/>\\nI hope this answers your question.<br/>\\nRegards,<br/>\\nGilla</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Have been making it (via Epicurious) for years, and as you mention, I completely skip the bain-marie in favor of throwing the cocoa, sugar, and butter in the microwave for a minute.  It works like a charm: I get that same cementy-grained texture, and I only dirty one bowl while I\\u2019m at it.  I have used high and low end cocoa, and it is a perfect brownie, either way.  The fat, if I had to explain it, is married to the rest of the ingredients in a way that never happens with a brownie made from chocolate.  And I think you\\u2019re absolutely right to compare the texture to that of a box brownie\\u2013it\\u2019s the same, and that\\u2019s a compliment.  The nasty *taste* of box brownies?

Also allows nut-free portions for the nut-averse\\u2013just leave part of the batter naked.  Pat them down lightly onto the batter to glue them on so they don\\u2019t fall off during handling.  </p>\\n<p>As for doubling the recipe:  Yes, a 9 x 13 pan works nicely.  (8 x 8 = 64 square inches x 2 = 128\\u2033; 9 x 13 = 117\\u2033\\u2013close enough! Since you want the batter the same thickness in either pan, you don\\u2019t need to know cubic inches, i.e. volume.)</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Lots of experts agree the higher acid content of natural cocoa sets eggs sooner in batters (which may help account for the extra cooking times noted in comments when dutched cocoa was used); but otherwise the experts seem to be all over the lot on which is better, and when.</p>\\n<p>I made side-by-side batches, one with a high-end dutched cocoa and the other with Hershey\\u2019s \\u2018Special Dark,\\u2019 which is only slightly alkelized.  Visually the difference was night vs. brown, as one would expect.  The Hersheys produced a slightly softer crumb, and while the batches tasted noticably different I didn\\u2019t find either one superior to the other:  They were just different. </p>\\n<p>I\\u2019m strongly inclined to get 4 or 5 different cocoa powders and whip up an equal number of brownie batches, then cut them up for a blind tasting among a crowd.  The good folks at Cook\\u2019s Illustrated did that with various recipes and reported being floored that the NON-dutched cocoas (indeed, the cheapest of them, which looks to have been Hershey\\u2019s natural cocoa) got the best marks across the board.

They are cooling on the counter now as the mezzuin sings the call to prayer.  Since I have very limited cooking equipment and no 8\\u2033 square pan, I wound up doubling the recipe and cooking it in a small pyrex oblong pan.  I figure that these will freeze well if my chocoholic son lets them get as far as that.  I was extremely nervous when I pulled the bowl off the pan with the water since it really looked like the cocoa had seized.  Can cocoa seize?  Anyway, I soldiered on, and everything seemed fine once I mixed in the eggs and flour, but I will know for sure once they cool and we try them.  As a note to the files, doubled, and cooked in the pyrex pan, this recipe required 37 minutes to bake.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Incredibly dense!  I would class this as an \\u201cafter-dinner\\u201d brownie, it\\u2019s very intense and rich.  My other brownie recipe is sweeter and more kid-friendly.  Having said that, my 1yr old had a nibble of your brownie today and definitely would have had a bit more\\u2026 an aficionado already!<br/>\\nHave you tried the olive oil brownie from Traveler\\u2019s Lunchbox?  Another different take but surprisingly delicious.<br/>\\nWhat\\u2019s with yr comment about jalapenos, btw? is that to do with the chana masala recipe??</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>these were really good. The kids love them ofcourse without any nuts and so do we. the batter was kind of thick and was hard to move around in my 8\\u201d square pan. Did I do something wrong. They were kind of thin, which was fine by me given the richness. But is that how they are supposed to be</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Hi B \\u2014 Yes, the batter was very thick for me too. Basically, it poured into the pan okay but then quickly stiffened up. This is just fine. I just spread it out and popped it in the oven.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I ran out of \\u2018good\\u2019 cocoa and used the backup Hershey\\u2019s in the cupboard and the I think they\\u2019re perfect. They are a little difficult to spread in the pan, but I gave up on spreading them perfectly and they still turned out wonderful.

They were still batter in the center and the edge ones were kind of soft.  It is not preventing anyone at work from ohhing and aahhing over the edge pieces.  The center was thrown in the freezer to be cut into squares to be cooked into individual brownies as needed.  I do not think that the batter will spread much.  I keep cookie dough in the freezer to cook one or two at a time, and I love the crunchy outside and the warm, melty, not cooked batter inside.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

(Wish you could go to Surfas!)  I didn\\u2019t even know what the Black Onyx was, but after reading up on it decided to go half-and-half with the two powders for another go at the brownies. Even at half-and-half, they turned out BLACK as night and because the Black Onyx is lower in fat, I added a couple more T. of butter. This produced an intriguing, profoundly cocoa-flavored but less-sweet brownie. Husband liked the original better -whenever I alter a recipe not to his liking, he acts flummoxed. \\u201cWhy would you change it?\\u201d  If I made them again, I probably would only add a couple T. of the Black Onyx. It\\u2019s the kind of thing I will probably throw in the pot next time I make chili. Just fyi!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I also no longer keep white sugar in the house, so I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of turbinado sugar.  Figured the heating would negate the texture issue.  Super simple to make\\u2026except for the parchment lining!  I had the durnedest time wrangling the paper into the pan.  I thought maybe it needed something to cling to, so I sprayed the pan and then put the paper in.  It kept popping out, so I sprayed the paper while in the plan, and tossed a spoon in to weight it down.  When I poured in the batter, the paper shifted and folded\\u2026grr.

These use cocoa, and have a lower fat content so a powdered egg replacer or anything you usually use in cakes, etc. would work.

While I sat in my childhood room and cried my silly heart out because First Love is Stupidly Cruel, my mom made me brownies, and when she brought them to me, still warm from the pan, we curled up on my childhood bed, and she told me Everything Would Be All Right, and sang me the same lullabye she did when I was a baby, a toddler, a gangly middle-schooler, and even an angry and sullen teenager who hated everyone.  </p>\\n<p>The brownies tasted like every celebration, every snow day, every late summer night, every sleep over, every relaxing end to a long day, and every warm and comforting hug I\\u2019ve ever known.  They were since dubbed Nostalgia Brownies, and they are, without a doubt, the one thing I\\u2019ll always associate with the love of my mother. </p>\\n<p>And they always had been, and always will be, made with cocoa.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I really like brownie but I have never been able to make it before \\u2013 it always turns out cakey and doesn\\u2019t taste rich and chocolatey and doesn\\u2019t cut well. And then I googled for brownie recipes and this came up. I made a few modifications: I added 3 medium size eggs instead of 2 large ones, I used 145g butter, 90g cocoa and I put it in a slightly smaller dish and baked for 10 mins on bake then 7 or so on fan bake. It was amazing. It is definitely a keeper and it was so easy! I didn\\u2019t do the whole thing with the skillet, I just heated in a saucepan over the stove and I didn\\u2019t have to line a dish with baking paper, I just greased it well with grapeseed oil (any vege oil will work) and it came out neatly. My new favourite recipe, and im looking at your other ones too!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I just had to make these tho, and I did read many of the posts before beginning to bake, was worried as others about the texture of the whole mix early on\\u2026Took out at twenty minutes and threw some sixty percent cacao chips on top and spread them for an icing as they melted\\u2026 cooled in fridge and cut with a plastic knife per a comment here.

I\\u2019m currently dairy and soy free (baby boy has an allergy), so the first time I subbed out oil (safflower) for the butter.  They were nice, but my husband found them a little less sweet then he likes (he\\u2019s a box brownie fan).  The next 2 times I continued to sub out the butter (I miss baking with butter!) and subbed 50% brown sugar for granulated sugar (and added a couple of tablespoons), to give a bit of a stronger flavour.  They are a definite hit!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

This is also a great recipe for someone like me who usually has cocoa on hand, but not chocolate, because it just gets eaten. Thanks! Love the site!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Ooh, these were wonderful!! I added some chocolate chips on top after they were done baking, put them back in the oven to melt and then transferred them to the freezer. Before serving, I decorated with shaved chocolate {microplane + chocolate bar}. Thank you!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I agree that this is the best cocoa brownies ( I\\u2019ve ever made).  I love your style of cooking.  Only one thing I always change in your sweet recipe is to cut the sugar down about 30%.  In this case, I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups and added unsweetened shredded coconuts.  This is going to be my bookmarks.  Thank you, Deb :))</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Hey! We baked these brownies and sold them at a school carnival and they were sold out really quickly! We love these brownies for their chocolatey goodness and gooeyness! Thank you for this wonderful recipe (:</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Hi,</p>\\n<p>Can u plz tell me what instructions would be on the papers if i were to turn those into gifts? I don\\u2019t know what order to add the liquids in to the dried ingredients since the wet and dry ingredients are added at different stages in the real recipe.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>For anyone who\\u2019d like to give this brownie recipe as a homemade \\u201cbox-mix\\u201d gift, here\\u2019s how I\\u2019d go about it:</p>\\n<p><b>Ingredients for your gift box:</b><br/>\\nBag 1: Sugar + cocoa + salt<br/>\\nBag 2: Flour + nuts (if using)</p>\\n<p><b>Ingredients your gift recipient will need:</b><br/>\\n10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks, 5 ounces or 141 grams) unsalted butter<br/>\\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\\n2 large eggs, cold<br/>\\n8\\xd78-inch square baking pan<br/>\\nParchment paper or foil to line pan</p>\\n<p><b>Directions for \\u201cgift mix\\u201d brownies:</b><br/>\\n1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325\\xb0F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8\\xd78-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides.</p>\\n<p>2. Combine the contents of <i>Bag 1</i> and your butter in a medium heatproof bowl and set the bowl in a wide skillet of barely simmering water. Stir from time to time until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth and hot enough that you want to remove your finger fairly quickly after dipping it in to test. Remove the bowl from the skillet and set aside briefly until the mixture is only warm, not hot. It looks fairly gritty at this point, but don\\u2019t fret \\u2014 it smooths out. [This step can also be completed in a microwave.]</p>\\n<p>3. Stir in your vanilla, then eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the contents of <i>Bag 2</i> and stir until you cannot see the flour any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with the wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Spread evenly in the lined pan.</p>\\n<p>4. Bake until a toothpick plunged into the center emerges slightly moist with batter, 20 to 25 minutes though it can occasionally take up to 10 additional minutes for them to set. Let cool completely on a rack.</p>\\n<p>5. Lift up the ends of the parchment or foil liner, and transfer the brownies to a cutting board. Cut into 16 or 25 squares.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Deb, I really must thank you for this recipe \\u2013 Definitely a keeper for years to come! Like others I have also tried the butter+sugar+cocoa step in the microwave and they always come out perfect. Brownie perfection.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

It has become my go-to \\u201cI need CHOCOLATE\\u201d week-day night recipe.  I like to sprinkle them with coarse sea-salt before baking and they are Ah-mazing!</p>\\n<p>I also never thought cocoa-powder was good for anything but hot chocolate, but it makes some kick-ass brownies.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>This is a great recipe, I love it because I always have cocoa around. Just tried melting the butter in a heavy bottom pan, then adding the sugar, cocoa &amp; salt directly into the pan\\u2026eventually cooling a bit and adding the rest of the ingredients, so no bowl at all. Turned out just as good!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Growing up, I always made brownies with cocoa- this is the best recipe out there. I just made these (again!) using dark brown sugar, and added 2 tsp ginger, 1.5 tsp cinnamon and .25 tsp cloves, and voila!  Gingerbread brownies! Delicious!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Yay! Another winner from Deb! I bought some Valrhona cocoa powder recently and was chomping at the bit for something to do with it. This recipe is a real winner. I like how you advised that this would be good for fans of boxed mixes, which are what I grew up eating with and did sing the praises of. As I am now a \\u201cfrom scratch\\u201d baker, I really appreciate these. Truly delicious. I will serve them with some good vanilla ice cream and some toasted pecans. Thanks.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I like the idea that these brownies have a rich texture and are not super sweet.  My daughter really isn\\u2019t a fan of chocolate, yet I would like to give these a try to see if they are something she would enjoy.  Putting the brownies is the fridge or freezer is something you always do, or just with this recipe of brownies?  Thank you, I\\u2019m excited to try and make them for my family lefse day this weekend!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Oh dear. I made these (with the metric measurements because I am from the UK) cooked them at 160c for 30 minutes. Crispy outside, nowhere near cooked inside. Not sure what I did wrong but they were so disappointing.  Tasty batter though. </p>\\n<p>My vegan brownie recipes (no chocolate just cocoa) cooked a lot more evenly and quicker.</p>\\n<p>Not sure what I did wrong here.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I just wanted to let you know that I made these over the weekend and they were perhaps the best brownies I\\u2019ve ever had.  Everyone raved about them.  The cooking time seemed to take right around the 30-35 min mark but that\\u2019s because we were under the notion that when cooking in glass baking dishes you cook 25 degrees cooler (which was NOT the case with these- we ended up turning them back up to 325).  Once again, these were phenomenal and the very first brownies I\\u2019ve ever baked from scratch!!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I made this recipe last Christmas as part of my baking for gift baskets and this year it is the ONLY thing I am baking. SO glad I found you online again because I\\u2019d lost the copy I\\u2019d written out. I do mine in mini muffin pan as a bite size treat and just a touch undercooked,then I place a rolo upside down in the center before they cool. I\\u2019ve never seen a plate clear so fast:)</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>YUM!  I know I\\u2019m late to comment here, but these are amazing.  I dusted them with powdered sugar and they look and taste scrumptious.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I just made these for the fourth time, and as always they\\u2019re perfect and I got so many compliments \\u2013 I took no credit, and just referred them to this site. A couple small adjustments that may help other readers: 1) lining the pan while waiting for the butter/cocoa/sugar mixture to cool after microwaving saved a few minutes (I was pressed for time), 2) adding half a bag of chocolate chips instead of nuts was a delicious addition, and 3) I doubled the recipe in a 9\\xd713 pan for 35 minutes, and only had a 150 gram bag of cocoa (missing about 1/4 cup) \\u2013 and the brownies still came out great. Thanks so much!!!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Also, a little shout out to not just you but also the commenters for always putting in such helpful hints and tips. For a novice baker/cook it is so great to get information on how to fix little issues that I come across!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Hi! Just made these for the second time and they are so frickin good! Really chocolately and fantastic texture.  I used the microwave method for melting and used regular old Hersheys cocoa and they are great.  If you use the microwave method they are one bowl brownies too! Thanks!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>The most delicious brownies EVER! I added walnuts to mine, and cut them into 25 pieces hoping that I could eat just one little brownie square at a time, and learn some self-control..but no..the are just way TOO good..I probably would have been better off not cutting them at all, and eating the entire pan in one gigantic brownie square given my endless indulgence!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Have made these many times as written and they\\u2019ve always been gorgeous. Had an egg crisis today and subbed in flax eggs, and to my surprise they turned out! The only differences were a bit less rise, a slightly nutty taste, and a little gooier, fudgier texture, not necessarily a bad thing in a brownie!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I just made those, it\\u2019s a great recipe! :D I added it some white chocolate kisses (Hershey\\u2019s) , omg, the brownie was so good!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>These are delicious and so easy to make! Instead of nuts, I added 2/3 cup of organic shredded coconut, and instead of vanilla (I was all out) I added a few drops of pure almond extract. The coconut added great texture and flavour, especially combined with the almond extract. Everyone who tried them wanted more!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Probably no one\\u2019s going to read this far down the comments, but for the person who does \\u2013 this is the only brownie recipe you will ever need, period.  I was super skeptical because my previous go-to was a Martha Stewart recipe that requires melted chocolate bars.  However, despite it being my favorite, I secretly wished it was less cake-like.  This cocoa brownie recipe makes THE perfect brownie \\u2013 candy chew top and edge, rich and fudgy middle.  I can\\u2019t believe there are comments here claiming that this recipe makes brownies that are too \\u201cgrown-up\\u201d or \\u201cbitter.\\u201d  What\\u2019s your definitive chocolate experience, Nestle Kwik in skim?</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Oh yum! This recipe was great. Very fudgy and not very cake like. It comes together in a snap, too. I heated the cocoa/butter/sugar in a pot on direct low heat, stirring constantly. I also served them with a chunky peanut butter frosting (quarter cup soft butter, quarter cup chunky PB, 3/4 cup powdered sugar and a tablespoon of milk). Chocolate and peanut butter are a match made in heaven \\u2013 it was awesome!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

They are so chewy and moist. I did however find that bakers chocolate squares works great! I was out of cocoa, so I used the chocolate squares and a bit less butter to compensate for the extra fat in the baking squares. They are awesome! Thank you sooooo much for this recipe!!! I love all your recipes so far. Thanks again:)</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Just wanted to say for the record that these work beautifully with Bob\\u2019s Red Mill gluten free all-purpose flour.  They take about 35 minutes to bake and need to cool completely before cutting, but they taste delicious.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Thanks for sharing :)</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Made me very happy :)</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Be sure to wipe the water on the blade with a clean dry towel first. Enjoy!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>A bit dry for me and crumbly.  Maybe less flour because there\\u2019s a lot of cocoa powder in it.  I put half muscovado sugar and half granulated.

Also I used one medium chicken egg, one small pigeon egg (my house mate raises king pigeons), and half a mashed banana instead of two large eggs and I substituted the last 1/4 cup of sugar for agave nectar. They were amazing. My housemate said he had never had homemade brownies that were so similar to store bought (which he loves!). Very fudgey and dense.

This is now my go-to brownie recipe!!! I love that they don\\u2019t need anything else, chocolate chips, nuts, whatever, they are just so chocolaty amazing exactly the way they are, and not too over-the-top sweet.I\\u2019ve always (secretly) loved box brownies, and these are similar, but soooo much better. If only every day were a brownie making day\\u2026</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>These are divine, literally found you\\u2019re site and within 10 mins i had the recipe printed and I was making them. XD</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>These were intense chocolaty amazingness! They were easy and used ingredients that most people always have on hand.  I used Hershey\\u2019s \\u201cSpecial Dark\\u201d cocoa powder. The brownies were so dark they appeared to be black in color. I used white whole wheat flour (which I almost always use instead of all purpose) and I did not add any nuts. I melted the ingredients together in a saucepan over low heat and had no problems with scorching so I guess the double boiler method is not necessary.I checked them at 20 min. then put them back in for 5 min. so 25 min. total cook time. They taste even better the next day. Thank you!!!! :)</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I just made this brownie recipe. Thank you for including the weights. I prefer to weigh the ingredients for baked products.  I like the precision.

The butter at 141 is correct, the sugar is a little high, should be 250. I have a super hard time getting a good read on cocoa powder. Most people would say that it is 85 grams a cup, so it would be too high here, but I get much more when I use my Valrhona cocoa, because it\\u2019s so rich. The flour is correct. I will adjust the sugar and the cocoa, with a note. Thank you.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Brownies are not usually something I make, but I was really intrigued by this recipe.  I made them for a potluck this weekend, and received many compliments-complete with eyes rolling back in the head with pleasure!  I had to bake mine for 40 minutes before they set, but it was worth multiple trips back to the kitchen to add another 5 minutes to the timer!!  Thanks for the recipe and perpetual inspiration!!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Confession time \\u2013 in a distracted moment I grabbed the 1/3 cup measure instead of the 1/4 cup and thus ended up with a full cup + 2 tbsp of cocoa in the mix\\u2026I threw in an extra tablespoon of butter but changed nothing else, baked in a glass pan at 300 for 35 minutes, and ended up with the most chocolatey, chewy brownies I have ever had.

I am, admittedly, a big fan of the box-brownie texture (though not the box-brownie flavor \\u2013 dull and lacking richness), and these really hit the spot!</p>\\n<p>You may know this already, but one trick that works really well to cut sticky brownies while hot/warm and still get a clean cut is to use a plastic knife (note: if the brownies are straight out of the oven the knife might soften and bend from the heat or coming into contact with the baking pan).</p>\\n<p>P.S. any thoughts on expanding your cook book tour to Israel?? :)</p>\\n</div>,\n",

The perfect brownie.  I had only one small piece (had to make sure they were okay to take to the party).  After the party I was craving brownies, so I made another batch.  To stop myself from eating all the brownies, I cut it into pieces and froze them.  In case anyone was wondering, they freeze beautifully.  So make a batch ahead of time and have them on hand for unexpected company.</p>\\n<p>The only problem with this recipe is that all the ingredients are on hand and it\\u2019s so easy to make.

It kind of looked gloppy in the pan, so I used the stick blender to smooth it out before I put it in the oven.</p>\\n<p>The resulting brownies looked &amp; sliced almost exactly like your pictures, but had a very glossy top that formed almost a natural layer of icing. They were very fudgy, but also a touch\\u2026 fiber-y? as could be expected. They were super moist and remained that way well after cooling, so I went ahead and kept them in the fridge.</p>\\n<p>I think I will probably experiment with it again, as they definitely didn\\u2019t taste beet-y, but had the kind of fruity/dark undertones one might expect from funky organic chocolates that claim to have \\u201cnotes of blueberry,\\u201d or upscale pour-over coffee.  </p>\\n<p>And no one else in my house would try them.

The different is in the mixing of the dry sugar, cocoa and salt with the butter. The other recipe belts the butter and mixes the sugar, cocoa and salt and then pours the melted butter into this dry mix. Then it proceeds like yours. Yours, you heat these dry ingredients at the same time as the butter\\u2026 What do you think the difference is in the result?

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Hi Deb! Longtime fan, but only rarely comment. Been wanting to tell you for ages how much I love your blog, the only one I consistently return to, both for its recipes AND its humor. Also, you have the BEST commenters, many of whom actually make your recipes first, and so many of whom share their own experiences, experiments, variations, &amp; sometimes even recipes! (As a recipe collector, I really appreciate that &amp; usually come to each new recipe late just so I can benefit from all the wonderful comments (tho\\u2019 they don\\u2019t take long to accumulate, LOL). </p>\\n<p>As for today\\u2019s recipe, though, want to comment myself on Rachel Anne\\u2019s question (#796) &amp; your response (#797). I believe she is referring to the 2012 Bon Appetite recipe in Epicurious called \\u201cCocoa Brownies\\u201d (just discovered it today &amp; noticed the similarities). Only diff from recipe above, besides that noted by Rachel: no nuts, 2T less butter &amp; cocoa, twice the salt &amp; vanilla, &amp; 1/3C flour (same as Medrich\\u2019s cocoa brownies w browned butter [YUM!]). The prep diff is that where Medrich heats the cocoa (+ sugar &amp; salt) WITH the butter, Bon App heats the butter alone, then pours it hot over the cocoa, sugar &amp; salt. Isn\\u2019t the purpose of heating them together (besides perhaps to allow some melting of the sugar) to \\u201cbloom\\u201d the cocoa, in order to get maximum flavor from it? Not sure of the chemistry of this, only the concept, but it sounds like an interesting experiment to see how the techniques differ in outcome. Oh, one last diff: Medrich recommends an exact # of \\u201cvigorous strokes\\u201d (40 in this, 60 in browned butter version)! Love that detail!<br/>\\nAnyway, thank you so much, Deb, for your always entertaining, educational &amp; inspirational blog\\u2026and for all the GREAT recipes! Love it; love you. :-D</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Thanks for the feedback \\u2014 it will be very helpful for people comparing the recipes. The good news is that I know both work well, though I have only used this one. (I confess to not finding browned butter + chocolate that appealing together, despite being over-the-moon about them separately.) The thing to keep in mind is that this is the original recipe and the BA one comes later, so the timeline is roughly:</p>\\n<p>2003: Recipe was first published in her book, \\u201cBittersweet\\u201d<br/>\\n2010: I shared it here.<br/>\\n2012: BA ran her brown butter version of them. She told Food52, \\u201cThose are Best Cocoa Brownies 3.0 or 4.0 or something like that.\\u201d As you mentioned, the browned butter version seems to use an addition 2T of butter and 1T extra flour. </p>\\n<p>In both versions, she suggests that you count the strokes. Needless to say, I thought that was charming but that there\\u2019s no need to be so particular.</p>\\n<p>I did notice that you don\\u2019t bloom the chocolate and butter together in the browned butter version, but I am sure she had her reasons it worked better without that step.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Thank you!!! For years I have been craving brownies but refused to give in to buying a box mix. This is the best scratch recipe I have found to date! I substituted coconut oil for the butter (major dairy allergy) which gave the baking aroma a hint of Mounds Bars, but faded to almost unnoticeable as they cooled. I may have pulled them a little soon, but since I love them a little fudgy that was fine. Since there are only two of us eating them (and to make sure we didn\\u2019t scarf them all down immediately!) after we each had our first two pieces I individually wrapped the remaining pieces in foil and froze them. That had a magical effect, much to my surprise! Both the flavor and texture improved when the pieces thawed \\u2013 I don\\u2019t know how or why.They were fabulous before \\u2013 after they were even better!

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I need to add my comments. This is my holy grail brownie recipe. I use Hershey\\u2019s Special Dark. I\\u2019ve tried it with Bensdorp dutch process cocoa and Hershey\\u2019s unsweetened (\\u201cregular\\u201d) and the chocolate flavor was too mild for me on both occasions. Solid chocolate based brownies also yield an ok flavor but with special dark (I\\u2019m not connected to them in anyway, other than as a consumer) it\\u2019s just perfect. I occasionally try other brownie recipes, but they\\u2019re always just ok. Very good with toasted coconut and/or chopped chocolate tossed on top. Takes about 40 minutes in my 1940\\u2019s gas oven.</p>\\n<p>Hint: hit control and F to find certain words (like \\u201cespresso\\u201d) in the comments.

I can\\u2019t imagine these being much<br/>\\n better that what came out of my oven tonight!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I\\u2019m baking for  a get together this weekend and I would love to put come armed with a wintry treat. My go to for peppermint brownies usually involves peppermint extract and crushed candy canes. This brownie recipe, out of all your fabulous ones, seems the best suited for this kind of tweaking. I guess I\\u2019m wondering a) is the recipe adaptable in this way? and b) would I replace the vanilla extract with peppermint extract or would you suggest another method? I\\u2019m sure some drizzled chocolate and peppermint pieces on top wouldn\\u2019t hurt! Thanks so much!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

Thank you, Deb!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Alexandra \\u2014 Sure, I\\u2019d just swap out the vanilla, but maybe just half and then taste it before adding the other half. Peppermint extract is much stronger, I\\u2019ve found.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>These are a very rich and fudgy brownie. I doubled and baked in a 9\\xd713 pan. The edges got a little bit too done and they stuck to the foil and therefore were hard to cut and serve. What is the reason for lining the pan with foil? Is it for ease of removing the brownies from the pan to cut? I have very similar recipe to this one that has little flour and I bake them in a greased pan and I find it works much better than lining the pan with foil.</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I felt sacrilegious about not loving Ina\\u2019s outrageous recipe, but my feelings of disloyalty are assuaged knowing that perhaps I\\u2019m just a cocoa brownie kind of girl.  Whether for a party, bake sale, or just pure greed, I\\u2019m usually baking brownies for a crowd, so I wanted to share that this recipe quadruples perfectly for a half sheet pan.  Better yet, the measurements are almost perfectly even, nearly achieving the holy grail of baking: a single measuring cup recipe.  Anyway, quadrupled quantities are 5 sticks of butter, 5 c sugar, 1 t salt, 2 t vanilla, 8 eggs, 4 c flour.  As for cocoa, I cheat a little on the quantity and just dump in the standard 8 oz (226 g) container.  That\\u2019s technically a little short, but I\\u2019ve never had any complaints, or any leftovers.  Thank you for the fab recipe and brownie epiphany, Deb!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

I followed it to the letter and it came out better than I could have imagined!  My oven needed 35 minutes.  I have been on the hunt for the best chocolate for several years now and have chosen Guittard.  It has this earthy blissful rich chocolate flavor that I haven\\u2019t found in any other brand.  So, that is the cocoa powder that I used in these awesome brownies.  If you haven\\u2019t tried it, you might want to give it a try.  It is fabulous!</p>\\n<p>Thank you again!</p>\\n</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I need to add my comments. This is my holy grail brownie recipe. I use Hershey\\u2019s Special Dark Cocoa. I\\u2019ve tried it with Bensdorp dutch process cocoa and Hershey\\u2019s unsweetened (\\u201cregular\\u201d) and the chocolate flavor was too mild for me on both occasions. Solid chocolate based brownies also yield an ok flavor but with special dark (I\\u2019m not connected to them in anyway, other than as a consumer) it\\u2019s just perfect. I occasionally try other brownie recipes, but they\\u2019re always just ok. Very good with toasted coconut and/or chopped chocolate tossed on top. Takes about 40 minutes in my 1940\\u2019s gas oven.</p>\\n<p>Hint: hit control and F to find certain words (like \\u201cespresso\\u201d) in the comments.

       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Made these yesterday and although they were quite delicious, I had size issues with them.  I used a 9\\u2033 square cake pan, and there was so little batter that they were barely a half-inch tall.  Using the 8\\u2033 pan recommended would not have solved this problem.  I think the quantities should be increase by at least 50%.  They\\u2019re so intense you will want tiny cuts (I got 30 out of the pan), but thicker would be better for textural reasons.  I pressed walnut pieces into the top 15 minutes into baking and it was the perfect timing for toasting them.  Even better would be a shower of flake salt to balance the intensity of the chocolate and sugar.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Using an 8 inch pan would definitely make the brownies thicker. An 8 inch pan has only 64 square inches whereas the 9 inch pan has 81 square inches.</p>\\n<p>Maybe try it again using a 9 inch pan?</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I make these in an 8-inch square and they are indeed quite thin brownies. But they\\u2019re also very fudgy; I think if they were thicker, it might be almost too chewy.</p>\\n</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>I can\\u2019t believe I took so long to make this. I followed the recipe faithfully, except that I used one cup of granulated brown sugar and a quarter cup of white. Like for Deb, it took me ten minutes extra, so 35 minutes in all, in the oven. It\\u2019s turned out delightfully rich and intense, and terribly dangerous to keep around without someone to share it with!</p>\\n</div>,\n",
